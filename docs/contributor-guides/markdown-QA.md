# 📝 Contribution Guidelines  

Thank you for contributing to this repository! To ensure that all Markdown files meet high-quality standards, we use **Vale** for spell checking and grammar checking, and **Markdownlint CLI** to enforce consistent Markdown style. After building the dev container both vale and markdownlint should be usable.

Before making any pull requests to the repository make sure that you run both Vale and Markdownlint and resolve all errors, warnings, and style changes that are given.

By following these guidelines, you help maintain clarity, readability, and professionalism across all documentation.
